This is one of the most beautiful air routes in the world culminating in a dramatic landing on a hillside surrounded by high mountains peaks. Upon arrival at Lukla, we meet our other crew members and after some packing and arrangements, we start our trek through the prosperous village of Lukla until we reach Phakding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 03: Phakding &ndash; Namche Bazaar&nbsp; (B,L,D) 3440M</strong><br />\r\nAfter breakfast start trek.

Pheriche is home to numerous yak pastures and potato fields, is located in a wide, windswept part of the valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 07: Pheriche&nbsp;(Acclimatization Day) (B,L,D)</strong><br />\r\nFull day rest for acclimatization.<em>Himalayan Rescue Association</em><br />\r\nThe Himalayan Rescue Association (HRA) runs a clinic/health post in Pheriche for trekkers and porters during peak trekking months. Talks on how to avoid altitude sickness are given daily.&nbsp; The HRA clinic can provide emergency communications (not as a public service) through their daily radio contact with Kathmandu and a satellite phone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 08: Pheriche &ndash; Lobuche&nbsp; (B,L,D) 4920M</strong><br />\r\nLeaving Pheriche the trail heads up the drainage of the Khumbu across a fairly level wind swept outwash plain. After about an hour it starts to climb steeply up the terminal moraine of the Khumbu Glacier.

The trail is rough in parts and it is important to progress slowly as we are now above 5000m for the first time. Shortly the pyramid peak of Pumori (7145m) comes into view and underneath this, dwarfed by its more exotic neighbour, we see the small black peak of Kala Pattar (5545m). This is the best vantage point for views of Everest and is our objective for tomorrow. The trail then descends off the moraine and down to the small settlement of Gorak Shep (5160m) where we rest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 10: Gorak Shep &ndash; Kala Patthar &ndash;&nbsp;Gorak Shep (B,L,D) </strong><br />\r\nThe ascent takes approx. 2 hours of steady walking to Kala Pather, stopping occasionally to take in the view of the increasing bulk of Everest. From the summit it is possible to see many of the key features of this great mountain &ndash; the South Col from which Hillary and Tenzing made their first ascent in 1953 is clearly visible. After spending time taking photographs and experiencing the greatest mountain view in the world we descend back to Gorak Shep for breakfast. After breakfast continue trek down to Lobuche.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Day 11: Gorak Shep &ndash; Everest Base Camp &ndash;&nbsp;Pheruche (B,L,D)</strong><br />\r\nEarly morning after breakfast set off to Everest Base Camp it will takes about 2 hrs to reach. Upon reaching spend some time taking picture after that return back to Gorak Shep and then continue down to Pheruche. Today you will be walking about 5to 7 hrs. We can now look forward to a reduction in altitude and easier going, as we descend back down the trail that we trekked up only a few days ago.<br />\r\n<em>Note: This is subject to every trekkers walking condition, may change to stay at Labuche if not able to reach Pheruche. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 12: </strong><strong>Pheruche-Tengboche-Namache (B,L,D)</strong><br />\r\nEarly morning breakfast and&nbsp; set off for Namche. It will very long day- about 7 to 8 hours of trek. Although can now look forward to a reduction in altitude and easier going, as we descend back down the trail that we trekked up only a few days ago. There is sometimes a sense of anti-climax about the return trek, however it is a chance to relax now that the hard part is over, and concentrate on those aspects of mountain life that may have been overlooked on the way up. The walking now seems easier due to the fact that our bodies are acclimatized.<br />\r\n<em>Note: This is subject to every trekkers walking condition, may change to stay at Phunki thanga if not able to reach Namche.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 13: Namche &ndash;Jorsale-Lukha (B,L,D) 2850M</strong><br />\r\nEarly morning breakfast and&nbsp; set off for Lukla.

Prayer flags on a wide pasture mark the junction with the trail leading to Rumbak. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 05:&nbsp;</strong><strong> Rumbak &ndash; Base of Gandala (4450 mts) 4 &ndash; 5 hrs walk. (B,L,D)</strong><br />\r\nAfter breakfast start trek, looking left towards Rumbak a fantastic multi-coloured peaked skyline ridge appears in the distance. We carry on up the main valley to a water mill and a bridge, which we cross. The trail ascends the valley gradually, and when the valley splits we take the right hand fork up past the one house village of Yurutse. We camp just past Yurutse at the base of the Ganda La, our first pass.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 06:</strong><strong>&nbsp; Gandala-Base of GandaLa - Skiu (3400 mts) 7- 8 hrs walk. (B,L,D)</strong><br />\r\nAfter breakfast start trek .The trail is clear as it zig zags towards the pass. As we climb the views become more spectacular. Behind us Stok Kangri dominates the skyline. Finally we reach the top of the Ganda La (4,950m) decked with colourful prayer flags, and the views are worth all the effort. Ahead is the Zanskar Range and behind are the Stok Mountains. Far below in the valley are the fields of Shingo. As we descend keep an eye open for marmots and blue sheep, both of which seem to thrive in these desolate, high altitude spots. An easy descent of 2 hours, we arrive Shingo. From here a long descent through a wooden ravine to Skiu village, where the trail meets the Markha valley.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 07.</strong><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Skiu&nbsp; &ndash; Markha &ndash; ( 3800 mts)&nbsp; 8 - 9 hrs walk. (B,L,D)</strong><br />\r\nAfter breakfast start trek, today trek will be fairly long, but easy walk today, as we trek along the valley to Markha. The terrain along the valley is not demanding, so there is plenty of opportunity to admire the magnificent scenery. The colours of the barren mountains of Ladakh are truly spectacular, pastel pinks, blues and greens shine in the brilliant sunshine and change colour dramatically as the sun rises and sets. The trail crosses the Markha River a few times, and although bridges have been built there may be some water crossing involved. Beyond the settlement of Chalak there is an impressive line of chortens to ward off any evil spirits trying to enter the valley - yo&#39; Ghostbusters! A medieval fort on the hillside tell us that we have almost reached Markha. Markha is a large village, the there will be time to explore in the afternoon. our camp will be on the lush grazing flats just outside the village.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 08.&nbsp;</strong><strong> Markha - Thathungtse (4330 mts) &ndash; 5- 6 hrs walk. (B,L,D)</strong><br />\r\nAfter breakfast&nbsp; within 45 minuts of walk we have to cross Markha river twice .Just beyond Markha the trail meets the Chacham Valley. Here is the Umlung gompa, set way above us on the cliff face. There is time to visit the monastery, which is the most important in the valley and is affiliated to Hemis. Continuing up the valley we walk through Umlung village to Hankar where there are more impressive fort ruins and a small gompa. From Hankar the trail turns off from the main valley and now follows the Nimaling stream to Thahungtse where we camp. We may be lucky and see wild sheep high up on the grazing areas above the campsite.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 09.</strong><strong>&nbsp; Thathungtse &ndash;Nimaling ( 4750 mts) 3 &ndash; 4 hrs walk. (B,L,D)</strong><br />\r\nAfter breakfast start trek, after the short walk to Nimaling. The trail climbs steeply to the plateau where the valley opens out. In this area there is no permanent habitation but during the summer months the shepherds bring their flocks of sheep, goats and dzos to graze on the high altitude pasture. The shepherds stay in stone shelters close to the grazing area for the whole summer, and we can often buy yoghurt or chang from them. Chang is a local beer brewed from barley and is an acquired taste...sorry, no Creemore beer available! In the evenings the animals are brought down from the hills and typical to have hundreds of them wandering through the campsite. We should have the afternoon in Nimaling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 10.</strong><strong> Nimaling -Sumdo (3650mts) 8- 9hrs walk &amp; drive to Leh (B,L,D) </strong><br />\r\nAfter breakfast start trek,&nbsp; the trail begins today by climbing to the Gongmaru La. It is a fairly long, steep ascent zig zagging to the top of the pass at 5,200m., but the views from the top are worth the effort. Looking back we see KangYangtse and Nun Kun in the far distance. Ahead there are views across the Stok Range and down to the Indus valley. The descent is steep at first to a tea tent, which is sometimes open for a welcome cup of tea. We then enter a spectacular gorge and descend gradually with a few small river crossings. High up on the barren cliffs we may spot the elusive Blue Sheep which inhabit this area. Passing through Shogdo we continue our descent to the village of Sumda. Rejoin our transport &amp; drive to Leh. Upon arrival check in hotel. Evening Dinner</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Day 11</strong>: <strong>Leh &ndash; Delhi &ndash; Final departure (B,L,D)</strong><br />\r\nAfter breakfast, transfer to airport for your flight to Delhi.
